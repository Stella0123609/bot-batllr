## Bot Battlr

Welcome to Bot Battlr, a React-based web application built with Vite, where you can build your own Bot Army! Browse a collection of bots, view detailed specs, enlist them into your army, and manage your selections with sorting and filtering.

 ## Features
Browse Bots: View a list of available bots with their details (name, class, health, damage, armor).

Bot Specs: Click a bot to view detailed information, including catchphrase, with options to enlist or go back.

Enlist Bots: Add bots to your army (one per class, removed from collection).

Release Bots: Remove bots from your army, returning them to the collection.

Discharge Bots: Permanently delete bots from the backend and army.

Sort Bots: Sort by health, damage, or armor.

Filter by Class: Filter bots by class (e.g., Support, Medic), with multiple selections.

Responsive Design: A clean, grid-based layout styled with Tailwind CSS.
